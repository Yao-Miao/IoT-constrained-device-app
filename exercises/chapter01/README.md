# Constrained Device Application (Connected Devices)

## Lab Module 01

Be sure to implement all the PIOT-CDA-* issues (requirements) listed at [PIOT-INF-01-001 - Chapter 01](https://github.com/orgs/programming-the-iot/projects/1#column-9974937).

### Description

What does your implementation do? 

At first, set up my CDA dev environment by using the GitHub Classroom repository. Then run the unit/integration tests in eclipse, make sure all sample code works well. Finally, create and checkout a new branch in my git repository.

How does your implementation work?

At first, check the git, python, and pip version in my system, make sure they all fulfill the requirements of the project. Secondly, clone the code from my git repository to the local. Thirdly, install virtualenv to prepare a separate python running environment. Finally, In order to setup CDA project and run unit/integration tests in eclipse, I install the PyDev and config the venv python interpreter as the default interpreter. The challenge is that I can't find the python interpreter exe file in my .venv folder. So I copy the python interpreter to the .venv/bin path and it works well.
